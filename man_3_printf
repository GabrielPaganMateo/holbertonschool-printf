.SH NAME
_printf - formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "main.h"

int printf(const char *format, ...);

_printf("%Specifier", VAR);

_printf("TEXT");
.SH DESCRIPTION
Produces output to the standard output stream (stdout). Output is under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments, accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of stdarg(3), are converted for output.
.SH Conversion specifiers
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.IP c
An int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
.IP "i, d"
An int argument is converted to signed decimal notation. Gives the minimum number of digits that must appear.
.IP s
A const char* argument, that is expected to be a pointer to a string, will be written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\\0').
.IP %
A '%' is written. No argument converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon succesful return, these functions return the number of characters printed.

If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.SH BUGS
No known defects have been identified. To report any bugs, send an email to 5673@holbertonstudents.com
